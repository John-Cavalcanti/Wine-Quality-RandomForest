# Wine-Quality-RandomForest

This notebook is a visualization and a machine learning training about a dataset that evaluates wine quality based on various aspects alcohol, some types of acid, sulphates etc.

## How to execute it

The way this notebook was created was on Google Colab, so my personal recommendation is to run the notebook code on Colab's cloud service.
Since this service runs on remote servers with their own gpu collection, it is going to run in a pretty decent time requiring minimal processment power from you computer.
